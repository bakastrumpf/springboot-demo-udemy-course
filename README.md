# Github public repository: springboot-demo-udemy-course | Nov 2023 onwards

Codes written alonside the Udemy course "Spring Boot 3, Spring 6 and Hibernate for Beginners," instructed by <a href="https://github.com/darbyluv2code">darbyluv2code Chad Darby</a>.
<br>
Basically, I try to follow the course and copy the codes as I go through the video lessons, but I also prefer renaming variables, methods, endpoints, files, and the like.

Originally, I started the course on 
<br>
<strong>Linux Mint Cinnamon 21.2, in Spring Tool Suite 4.10.0, with MySQL Workbench and Postman</strong>, 
<br>
but, due to numerous issues that emerged, I moved to a completely new setup: 
<br>
<strong>Linux Mint Cinnamon 21.3, IntelliJ Ultimate, Java & openJDK 19.0.2, SDK 21.0, mariaDB 10.6, dBeaver 22.3.3, and Hoppscotch</strong>.
