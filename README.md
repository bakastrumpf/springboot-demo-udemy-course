# Github public repository: springboot-demo-udemy-course | Nov 2023 onwards

Codes written alonside the "Spring Boot 3, Spring 6 and Hibernate for Beginners" udemy gourse, given by iluv2code Chad Darby.

Originally, I started the course on Linux Mint Cinnamon 21.2, in Spring Tool Suite 4.10.0, with MySQL Workbench and Postman, 
but, due to numerous issues that emerged, I moved to a completely new setup: 
Linux Mint Cinnamon 21.3, IntelliJ Ultimate, Java & openJDK 19.0.2, mariaDB 10.6, dBeaver 22.3.3, and Hoppscotch.
